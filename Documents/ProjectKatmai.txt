--What are UWIDs--
UWIDs are Universal Window IDs. They are used by Katmai to render windows. You will need to add (as a developer) a UWID Installer which will add your UWID to app.ini (Your config file) Katmai will search for this app.ini file with the window characteristics and will then draw the window.

A UWID should never be less than 1000 and will be blocked by Katmai if it is.
A UWID should never be more than 10000000 and will be blocked by Katmai if it is. 9,999,000 unique UWIDs to choose from. If a UWID conflict occurs, the app probably won't work - UWIDs will be saved in the UWID config file, uwid.ini.
